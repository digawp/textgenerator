textgenerator
=============

CS2020 2014 PS6

This java project is actually a school project of mine. It generates a string of English sentences given a text file.

Place a .txt file in the same level as the package folder as the base text for the TextGenerator to generate a MarkovModel, and supply the order of the Markov Model as well as the length of string you want to generate. An order of 3 to 5 is recommended to generate a (somewhat) sensible English sentences.

There are still problem with the text generator (see issues section) but if you want, feel free to play with it. If possible, suggest a fix for the issues I raised! I am still very new at this.
